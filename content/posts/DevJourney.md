# DevJourney

As a child, I loved legos, even though I had only 1 lego in my life. But the feeling of creating some structure, a character, scenarios, tools, etc. Makes me feel joyful. Since then I have always wanted to become an inventor. When I discovered the career of an inventor, did not exist I choose (a bit disappointed) to code because robots are expensive and programming is cheap and enables you to do whatever you want. Then I submit my application for a Computer Science Engineering bachelor at Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla. There I enrolled in a program sponsored by Microsoft called "Innovaccion virtual" which consists of being evangelized with cloud technologies. Later on, in a future edition called "Launch X" (Fullstack development) Carlo Gilmar taught us backend, CLI, VCS, OS, text editors, Source Code Hosting Platforms, Software Design, TDD, HTTP and web, CI/CD, linters.

However, I met Jose R. Zuñiga (@neodevelop) and with the help of MakingDevs, I reinforced and enhanced the skills I've acquired before such as.
